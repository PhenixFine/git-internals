# git-internals
Stage 7 of 7 for JetBrains Academy - Kotlin - [Git Internals project](https://hyperskill.org/projects/110/stages/601/implement).  
The program allows the user to work with Git files with the following commands:  
• list-branches - list the branches of a given directory, marking the current branch with a *  
• cat-file - reads the content of a git object file ( requires the object's hash from the user )  
• log - prints the log of the given branch ( it currently only follows the first parent, if a commit has more than one )  
• commit-tree - prints out the full file tree of a given commit ( requires the object's hash from the user )
